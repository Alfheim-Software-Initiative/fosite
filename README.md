# Fosite
A secure operating system written from scratch.  

## Overview
Fosite is named after the great Norse god of Justice and the one who settles all disputes.
The operating is designed to run as an application completely sandboxed from the host
operating system running it's own kernel and system resources.  You also can install
Fosite onto a bare-metal machine.  It is designed from the ground up to securely connect
multiple machines connected on a network for easy system administration and auditing.

Fosite is available in multiple versions - application only, distribution and application,
and distribution.  This is not related to ANY other operating system, but borrows heavily
from the Linux Operating System for it's power and ease of use.  It is licensed under MIT,
and being developed in the open so that anyone that wants to develop on it can.

The distribution is an Integrated Systems Environment (ISE), and [while each piece of software
on the system is it's own entity] all software on the system is developed in tandem with the
distribution, thus allowing for a seamless distribution designed out of the box to be an
all-in-one distribution.
